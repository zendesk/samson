# Used to collect metrics of cycle time(elapsed time needed to deliver a project to production)
# Check out https://about.gitlab.com/2019/03/04/reduce-cycle-time/ for more details on cycle time
# The main objective for this is to gain more insight on the efficiency of the end-to-end project development process
# There are 2 key metrics:
# 1. PR - Production: this will show the time needed for a pull request to get deployed to production environment
# 2. Staging - Production: this will show the time needed to deliver from staging(non-production environment)
#                          to production environment.
