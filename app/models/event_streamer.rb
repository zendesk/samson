# Streams the terminal output events from a output source to a destination IO
# stream.
#
# The streamed data will be in the forms of Server Sent Event messages:
#
#   event: append
#   data: { "msg": "hello" }
#
#   event: replace
#   data: { "msg" {"world\n" }
#
# The `append` event is meant to insert a new line at the end of some client
# buffer while the `replace` event is meant to replace the last line of the
# client buffer with the data contained in the message.
#
# Example:
#
#   # `stream` is e.g. the response.stream object in a Rails controller.
#   streamer = EventStreamer.new(stream)
#
#   # `output` is anything that responds to `#each`. The block will be called
#   # with each chunk of data that is about to be streamed - its return value
#   # will be sent instead.
#   streamer.start(output) {|chunk| chunk.html_safe }
#
