# Plugins

Plugins enable the core of samson to stay clean, they can add UI elements to pages that support it,
and hook into events such as before and after deploys see
[supported hooks](https://github.com/zendesk/samson/blob/master/lib/samson/hooks.rb#L7-L43).

Each plugin is a rails engine.

## Enabling Plugins

The `PLUGINS` environment variable decides which plugins are enabled.

Use a comma-separated list:

`PLUGINS="flowdock,env,slack_webhooks"`

To enable all plugins, use "all":

`PLUGINS="all"`

To disable selected plugins, use "all", and a comma-separated list of plugins, with a minus sign in front of each:

`PLUGINS="all,-flowdock,-slack_webhooks"`
