# Getting Started

Run the bootstrap script to use the test credentials.

```bash
script/bootstrap
rails s
open http://localhost:3000
```

 - Add a new project http://localhost:3000/projects/new
 - name: example-project url: git@github.com:samson-test-org/example-project.git
 - Create a Stage
 - Deploy!

# Permission

Samson assumes the user you are running the service under has permission to perform the various tasks like
cloning repositories. For private repositories especially, this may necessitate uploading SSH keys or keychaining the user/password:
* https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git

Otherwise when creating a new project you may get the error "<Repository URL> is not valid or accessible".

# Configuration

## Database

For very small deployments, SQLite is sufficient, however you may want to leverage MySQL or PostgreSQL. 
Set up a production block in database.yml with the settings to connect to your DB then run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:setup`

## Webserver

Configure `config/puma.rb` as you need. See [puma's documentation](https://github.com/puma/puma/) for details. You can start the server using this file by doing `puma -C config/puma.rb`.

## Settings

Set the following variables in your `.env` file or set them as environment variables in the shell you spawn the webserver from:

<table>

    <tr><th>Key</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th></tr>

      <td>SECRET_TOKEN</td>
