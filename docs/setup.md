# Getting Started

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose up
open http://$DOCKER_HOST_IP:9080
```

When not running on `192.168.42.45` use a different auth provider, the IP is hardcoded.

### Local
```bash
sudo apt-get install mysql-dev pg-dev nodejs
bin/setup # Run the setup script to use the test credentials.
rails s
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Zdi

1. zdi samson bootstrap # to create the database volume
2. `bin/setup` # to setup the config files and seed the db
3. zdi services restart # always a good idea
4. zdi samson -d restart

### Setup
 - Add a new project http://localhost:3000/projects/new
 - name: example-project url: git@github.com:samson-test-org/example-project.git
 - Create a Stage
 - Deploy!

# Permission

Samson assumes the user you are running the service under has permission to perform the various tasks like
cloning repositories. For private repositories especially, this may necessitate uploading SSH keys or keychaining the user/password:
* https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git

Otherwise when creating a new project you may get the error "<Repository URL> is not valid or accessible".

# Configuration

## Database

For very small deployments, SQLite is sufficient, however you may want to leverage MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Set up a production block in database.yml with the settings to connect to your DB then run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:setup`

## Webserver

Configure `config/puma.rb` as you need. See [puma's documentation](https://github.com/puma/puma/) for details. You can start the server using this file by doing `puma -C config/puma.rb`.

### 0-Downtime restarts

Use this to create a server that can receive `kill -SIGUSR1` and perform a clean restart without dropping any requests.

```
bundle exec --keep-file-descriptors puma --restart-command "bundle exec --keep-file-descriptors puma"
```

## Settings

Set the following variables in your `.env` file or set them as environment variables in the shell you spawn the webserver from:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr><th>Key</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SECRET_TOKEN</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
