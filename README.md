### Workflow

Create a project and 1 or more stages (staging/production etc),
then selects a version and start the deploy.

Samson will:
 - clone git repository
 - execute commands associated with the stage (or execute API calls for kubernetes)
 - stream deploy output to everybody who wants to watch
 - persist deploy output for future review
