### How?

Samson works by ensuring a git repository for a project is up-to-date, and then executes the commands associated with a stage. If you want to find out exactly what's going on, have a read through [JobExecution](https://github.com/zendesk/samson/blob/master/app/models/job_execution.rb).

Streaming is done through a [controller](app/controllers/streams_controller.rb) that uses [server-sent events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) to display to the client.
